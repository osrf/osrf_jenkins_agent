## Underautomated setup instructions
# This section lists operations which were resistant to initial attempts to
# automate them.
# Hopefully with time, effort, and documentation we can find ways to automate these steps as well.

# Start by checking for updates and running any pending OS updates.
# Do not do major macOS version upgrades, such as Monterey -> Ventura.

# `administrator` user should already exist and the password is available in Bitwarden.

# Create `jenkins` account with sudo / administrator access to the host.
# Set it up for passwordless sudo.

# Log in as the Jenkins user, leaving accessibility, siri, and apple ID sign in disabled during initial user setup.

# Enable autologin for Jenkins from Login options, this is required so that xquartz is started on system boot.

# Verify SSH and VNC remote access are enabled, which should already true for
# our hosted machines.
# Verify remote management is enabled _only_ for administrator

# Verify wifi and bluetooth are disabled, which should already be true for
# our hosted machines.

# Disable Spotlight indexing. It's worth doing globally but at the very least
# make sure that `/Users/jenkins` and `/usr/local` are disabled.

# In Energy Saver settings, verify that display and system sleep are disabled
# completely by setting them to Never. There is no attached display so this
# will not spend extra watts.


# Run `git` or `cc` so that macOS prompts you to install developer tools.

# Enable developer mode with `/usr/sbin/DevToolsSecurity -enable`

# As the `jenkins` user, install homebrew using the instructions on https://brew.sh

# Run `brew doctor` to verify that homebrew has no complaints post-installation.
